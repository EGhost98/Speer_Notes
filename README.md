## How to Run the API Project
To run the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone <repository_url>`
2. Create a Virtual Python Environment `python -m venv env`.
3. Activate the Virtual Environment (if using Git-Bash) `source env/Scripts/Activate`
4. Navigate to the project directory: `cd Speer_Notes`
5. Install the dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
6. Change Database Parameters in .env as required. (local or Your Own Database or use the provided vercel Postgres Database).
7. Run the migrate command `python manage.py migrate`. (If Using your own Postgres Database)
8. Run the application: `python manage.py runserver`
9. Access the Swagger Open-API Documentation of API's at : `http://localhost:8000/swagger/`

## How to run the Tests

1. Follow Steps from above from 1-7.
2. Run `python manage.py test` (Using Django's Default Python standard unittest library).
3. Tests can be Found in test folder in each respective apps.

## Reason For Choice of Tech Stack

### Technologies Used

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Backend Framework:** Django
- **REST Framework:** Django Rest Framework (DRF)
- **Database:** PostgreSQL
- **Test Framework:** Python Standard Unittest Library

### Why Python?

Python was chosen for this project due to its versatility, readability, and extensive library support. In the context of this project, Python's simplicity facilitates rapid development and ensures maintainability.

### Why Django?

Django, being a high-level web framework for Python, is an ideal choice for this project. Its rapid development capabilities, clean design principles, and built-in tools like the ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) for database interactions perfectly suit the requirements of creating a secure and scalable RESTful API.

### Why Django Rest Framework (DRF)?

Django Rest Framework (DRF) is an essential component for building Web APIs within the Django framework. It streamlines the process of developing RESTful APIs by providing serialization, authentication, and viewsets. Its integration with Django makes it a powerful choice for handling API design patterns, ensuring efficiency in developing robust API endpoints for this project.

### Why PostgreSQL?

PostgreSQL, as the chosen database management system, offers ACID compliance, support for complex queries, and excellent performance. In the context of this project, the decision to utilize indexing in PostgreSQL enhances search efficiency. Indexing involves creating data structures on specific columns, significantly reducing the time needed to retrieve search resultsâ€”a crucial factor in the project's note-search functionality.

### Why Python Standard Unittest Library?

The Python standard `unittest` library serves as the primary testing framework for this project. Its simplicity and extensibility make it well-suited for crafting unit tests tailored to the project's Django applications.

### Additional Testing with Postman

Postman was employed for API testing during the development process. This tool provides a user-friendly interface for testing API endpoints, allowing for comprehensive validation of the API's functionality, data handling, and error responses.

## Search Functionality

This project includes a robust search functionality that enables users to search for notes based on keywords. The search feature enhances user experience by providing a quick and efficient way to locate relevant information.

### Implementation

The search functionality is implemented using Django's built-in `SearchVector` and `SearchVectorField` along with PostgreSQL's `GinIndex` for efficient full-text searching.

#### Model Configuration

```python
# notes/models.py

from django.contrib.postgres.search import SearchVectorField, SearchVector
from django.contrib.postgres.indexes import GinIndex

class Note(models.Model):
    # ... other fields ...
    search_vector = SearchVectorField(null=True, blank=True)

    class Meta:
        indexes = [
            models.Index(fields=['user']),
            GinIndex(fields=['search_vector']),
        ]
```

## Rate Limiting

This project implements rate limiting to control the number of requests made to the API within a specified time period. Rate limiting is employed to prevent abuse, ensure fair usage, and maintain system stability.

### Overview

The rate limiting strategy involves restricting the number of requests a user can make to the API within a defined timeframe. This is achieved using Django Rest Framework's built-in `throttle_classes` and `DEFAULT_THROTTLE_RATES` settings.

### Rate Limiting Configuration

The following rate limits are applied:

- **Anon Rate Limit:** Specifies the maximum number of requests anonymous users can make per minute.
- **User Rate Limit:** Limits the number of requests authenticated users can make per minute.

### Configuration Example

```python
# settings.py

REST_FRAMEWORK = {
    'DEFAULT_THROTTLE_RATES': {
        'anon': '8/minute',
        'user': '20/minute',
    },
    'DEFAULT_THROTTLE_CLASSES': [
        'rest_framework.throttling.AnonRateThrottle',
        'rest_framework.throttling.UserRateThrottle',
    ],
}
```
